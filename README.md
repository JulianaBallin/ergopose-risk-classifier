# ergopose-risk-classifier
A lightweight computer vision system using webcam-based body landmark detection to calculate posture angles (neck, trunk, and shoulders) and classify ergonomic risk levels (low, medium, or high) using an artificial neural network. Developed as a supervised machine learning project for ergonomic posture assessment during seated work.

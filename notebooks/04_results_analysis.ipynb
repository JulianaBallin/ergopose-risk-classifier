    "# ErgoPose Risk Classifier — Results Analysis and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents the **final analysis and discussion of results** obtained during the model training phase.  \n",
    "It focuses on interpreting the neural network’s performance and the ergonomic meaning behind the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- Load and review the evaluation results from trained models.\n",
    "- Visualize performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "- Plot confusion matrices and compare predictions vs. ground truth.\n",
    "- Analyze errors and misclassifications (e.g., confusing medium vs. high risk).\n",
    "- Interpret model behavior in the context of ergonomic risk identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input and Output\n",
    "- **Input:** Saved model outputs, metrics, and logs from `03_model_training.ipynb`.\n",
    "- **Output:** Graphs, tables, and textual conclusions summarizing model performance and insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights\n",
    "- Identify which body postures the model predicts best and which it confuses.\n",
    "- Highlight the most influential features (keypoints) for risk classification.\n",
    "- Discuss limitations, sources of error, and recommendations for improvement.\n",
    "- Connect quantitative findings to ergonomic relevance in real-world seated work scenarios.\n"

    "# ErgoPose Risk Classifier — Model Training and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements the **model training and evaluation stage** of the ErgoPose Risk Classifier project.  \n",
    "We will train **supervised learning models**, focusing on **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**, to predict ergonomic risk levels based on the extracted pose features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- Load the preprocessed dataset containing numerical features and the target variable (`risk_level`).\n",
    "- Split the data into training and testing subsets.\n",
    "- Define the machine learning task: *multiclass classification* (low, medium, high).\n",
    "- Implement and tune an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** using a grid of hyperparameters.\n",
    "- Apply **cross-validation** and performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score).\n",
    "- Compare performance against baseline models (e.g., Decision Tree, SVM).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input and Output\n",
    "- **Input:** `data/processed/clean_postural_risk_dataset.csv`\n",
    "- **Output:** Trained ANN model, metrics tables, and visual performance comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Deliverables\n",
    "- Confusion matrix and classification report.\n",
    "- Learning curves and loss evolution plots.\n",
    "- Discussion of results: accuracy trends, model overfitting/underfitting analysis, and future improvements.\n"
